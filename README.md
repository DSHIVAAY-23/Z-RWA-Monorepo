# Z-RWA — ZK Compliance Infrastructure for Indian RWA

> Privacy-preserving KYC for Real World Asset tokenization on Solana.  
> Identity never leaves your device. Compliance is proven cryptographically.

## The Problem

India's DPDP Act 2023 makes storing Aadhaar/PAN on public blockchains **illegal**.  
Traditional KYC requires trusting a centralized verifier — a single point of failure.  
Institutions won't enter permissionless DeFi without cryptographic compliance guarantees.

## The Solution

Z-RWA generates a **Groth16 ZK proof** that an investor is compliant — without revealing any identity data.

```
User uploads Aadhaar/PAN locally
        ↓
Poseidon hash computed on device
        ↓
SnarkJS (Groth16) generates ZK compliance proof
        ↓
Only 260-byte proof submitted to Solana
        ↓
Anchor program verifies proof on-chain
        ↓
Token2022 RWA token minted to wallet
```

Chain learns nothing. Compliance is proven. Identity stays private.

## Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| ZK Proving | SnarkJS / Circom (Groth16) |
| On-chain | Solana — Anchor framework |
| Token Standard | Token2022 with custom transfer hooks |
| Hashing | Poseidon (ZK-friendly) |
| Frontend | Next.js + Wallet Adapter |
| Network | Solana Devnet |

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Proof Size | 260 bytes |
| Constraints | 7,493,634 |
| Proving Time | ~2-3 seconds |
| On-chain Verification | Sub-second |
| Proof Format | Groth16 |

---

## How It Works

1. **Document Upload** — Aadhaar/PAN processed locally via OCR. Zero data transmitted.
2. **ZK Proof Generation** — SnarkJS runs the Circom compliance circuit. Groth16 proof generated.
3. **On-chain Submission** — 260-byte proof submitted to Solana via Anchor program.
4. **Token Minting** — `z_rwa_verifier` program verifies proof → Token2022 minted to wallet.
5. **Transfer Enforcement** — Every RWA transfer gated by Token2022 hook checking proof validity.

## Why This Matters

- **SEBI** is expected to release an RWA framework in 2026 — infrastructure needs to exist before regulation
- **500M+ Indian retail investors** cannot participate in RWA DeFi today due to compliance barriers
- **DPDP Act 2023** makes centralized KYC storage a legal liability — ZK is the only compliant path

---

## Security Model

- Identity data never leaves the user's device
- Only a 260-byte Groth16 proof is submitted on-chain
- Token2022 transfer hooks enforce compliance on every transfer — not just at mint
- Proof binding via `ZK_RAG_VKEY` prevents proof replay across different verification keys

---

## QVAC Integration (Tether Side Track)

Z-RWA uses QVAC SDK for fully local document OCR — no cloud, no API calls.

### Why QVAC?
Our privacy guarantee is "identity never leaves your device."
QVAC OCR makes this technically enforceable:
- Aadhaar/PAN OCR runs entirely on the user's hardware
- QVAC uses Vulkan API — hardware-agnostic, works on any GPU
- Offline capable — no internet required for document processing

### QVAC Modules Used
- @qvac/sdk — Native SDK for local processing
- @qvac/ocr-onnx — Local OCR for Aadhaar/PAN document extraction

### Setup
npm install @qvac/sdk @qvac/ocr-onnx

### Vercel / Serverless Optimization
To run QVAC efficiently on Vercel:
1. **Dynamic /tmp Loading**: Since Vercel has a 50MB function size limit, we cannot bundle 95MB models. The system is configured to automatically download models from a CDN/GitHub to `/tmp` on the first request.
2. **Increase Memory**: In your Vercel Dashboard, set the Function Memory to at least **2048MB** (3008MB recommended).
3. **External Packages**: `next.config.js` treats `@qvac/sdk` and `bare-runtime` as external.

## Dodo Payments Integration

**Flow:** INR Payment (UPI/Card) → Dodo Webhook → ZK Proof Generation → Token2022 Mint

**Live:** https://z-rwa-monorepo.vercel.app/invest

Setup:
1. Get testmode API key from app.dodopayments.com
2. Create a one-time payment product in Dodo dashboard  
3. Add to .env: DODO_API_KEY, DODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_PRODUCT_ID
4. Set webhook URL to: https://z-rwa-monorepo.vercel.app/api/dodo-webhook
